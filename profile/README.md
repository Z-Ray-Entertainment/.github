## Hi there 👋
We are Z-Ray Entertainment.  
Beside our work on various open source projects, not just or own, we are also involved into content creation across YouTube, Twitch and Odysee.  

Also we're working on commercial projects such as our own Game series Space Conflicts for which we've once developed our own game engine for.  
But dropped the endeavor in favor of using Godot.  

Our 18+ years expertise cover a wide range of programming languages, frameworks and applications such as but not limited to:
- Java, Python, Rust, C
- JavaScript, JSF, Angular
- OpenGL, Vulkan
- Godot, Blender, Autodesk Maya, Davinci Resolve, Krita, Inkscape
and many more!

With our passion for open source software we are also proud to be part of the change this world needs to improve.

FOSS all the way baby!
